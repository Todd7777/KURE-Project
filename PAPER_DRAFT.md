## Abstract

Diffusion models excel at single-object generation but struggle with multi-object composition, attribute binding, spatial relations, and explicit negation—precisely the instructions users care about. Flow matching reframes diffusion as learning a time-dependent velocity field, enabling few-step inference through rectified flows (RF). However, conventional RF uses linear interpolation between prior and data, forcing trajectories through low-probability regions where compositional failures arise. We propose **Nonlinear Rectified Flows (NRF)**, which replace straight-line supervision with three geometry-aware teachers: (1) **quadratic** paths with learnable curvature, (2) **cubic splines** with prompt-aware control points and manifold regularization, and (3) **Schrödinger Bridge** drifts from entropic optimal transport. We integrate VAE decoder-induced pullback metrics to measure path length and curvature on the learned image manifold. On COCO and a targeted compositional suite stressing attributes, spatial relations, and negation, NRF improves FID by 17% and compositional CLIPScore by 28% over linear RF at 4-step budgets, while maintaining RF's efficiency. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear supervision—"curved because the data demand it"—delivers faster, more faithful, and less hallucinatory image generation.

## 1. Introduction

### The Compositional Challenge

When AI image generation fails, it is seldom on single-object prompts like "a cat" or "a tree." Instead, failures emerge on instructions people actually care about:

- **Attribute binding**: "A red cube and a blue sphere" → model generates red sphere
- **Spatial relations**: "A cat on top of a table" → cat appears beside table
- **Explicit negation**: "A dog without a collar" → dog wears collar

These compositional failures persist despite impressive progress in diffusion models [1, 2]. The root cause: diffusion requires many denoising steps to satisfy complex prompts, hindering latency-sensitive applications like live editors and on-device tools.

### Flow Matching and Rectified Flows

Flow matching [3] reframes diffusion as learning a time-dependent velocity field $v_\theta(x_t, t, c)$ whose ODE can be integrated in far fewer steps:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = v_\theta(x_t, t, c), \quad x_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I), \quad x_1 \sim p_{\text{data}}$$

**Rectified Flow (RF)** [4] provides an explicit teacher signal via linear interpolation:

$$x_t = (1-t) z_0 + t x_1, \quad v_t^* = x_1 - z_0$$

This constant-velocity supervision enables 4-8 step sampling with quality comparable to 50+ step diffusion. However, the linear teacher has a critical limitation: **straight-line trajectories can traverse low-probability regions of the image manifold**, precisely where compositional failures arise.

### Our Contribution: Nonlinear Rectified Flows

We propose **Nonlinear Rectified Flows (NRF)**, which replace the linear teacher with three increasingly expressive, geometry-aware alternatives:

1. **Quadratic Teacher**: Minimal curved departure with learnable curvature parameter $\alpha$
   $$x_t = (1-t) z_0 + t x_1 + \alpha t(1-t)(x_1 - z_0)$$

2. **Cubic Spline Teacher**: Prompt-aware control points with path length and curvature regularization
   - Lightweight transformer predicts $K$ control points conditioned on text
   - Catmull-Rom splines ensure smooth, twice-differentiable trajectories
   - Regularization: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} = \lambda_1 \|\text{path}\| + \lambda_2 \|\kappa\|^2$

3. **Schrödinger Bridge Teacher**: Distribution-aware drift from entropic optimal transport
   - Solve Schrödinger Bridge in latent space using Sinkhorn + Nyström
   - Distill time-varying drift $u_t^*$ as supervision
   - Eliminates linear-teacher bias entirely

**Key Innovation**: We integrate **VAE decoder-induced pullback metrics** to compute geodesic distances and curvature on the learned image manifold:

$$G(z) = J_D(z)^\top J_D(z)$$

where $J_D(z)$ is the Jacobian of the VAE decoder. This turns "straight by assumption" into "short and smooth by design."

### Experimental Validation

We pretrain on CC3M and LAION-Aesthetics, and evaluate on:
- **COCO captions** for standard metrics (FID, IS, CLIPScore)
- **Compositional suite** stressing attributes, spatial relations, and negation

At 4-step budgets:
- **FID**: 15.1 (NRF-Spline) vs 18.2 (Linear RF) → **17% improvement**
- **Compositional CLIPScore**: 0.74 vs 0.58 → **28% improvement**
- **Negation handling**: 0.67 vs 0.52 → **29% improvement**

## 2. Related Work

### Diffusion Models
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) [1] and Score-Based Models [2] achieve state-of-the-art image quality but require 50-1000 steps. DDIM [5] and DPM-Solver [6] accelerate sampling but still need 20-50 steps for complex prompts.

### Flow Matching
Flow Matching [3] learns continuous normalizing flows via simulation-free training. Rectified Flow [4] provides straight-line teacher signals, enabling 4-8 step sampling. Our work extends RF with nonlinear teachers.

### Compositional Generation
DALL-E 2 [7], Imagen [8], and Stable Diffusion [9] struggle with compositional prompts. Structured Diffusion [10] and Composable Diffusion [11] improve composition but increase inference cost. NRF addresses composition at the trajectory level.

### Optimal Transport
Schrödinger Bridges [12] and entropic OT [13] provide distribution-aware transport. We apply these to latent-space flow matching with scalable Nyström approximations.

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Rectified Flow Baseline

Standard RF learns a velocity field $v_\theta(x_t, t, c)$ to match the linear teacher:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{RF}} = \mathbb{E}_{z_0, x_1, t} \|v_\theta(x_t, t, c) - (x_1 - z_0)\|^2$$

where $x_t = (1-t) z_0 + t x_1$, $z_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$, $x_1 \sim p_{\text{data}}$, $t \sim \mathcal{U}[0,1]$.

**Limitation**: Constant velocity forces straight paths that may traverse low-density regions.

### 3.2 Quadratic Teacher

We introduce a curvature term:

$$x_t = (1-t) z_0 + t x_1 + \alpha t(1-t) \Delta$$

where $\Delta = x_1 - z_0$ and $\alpha$ controls curvature. The velocity becomes:

$$v_t = (1 + \alpha(1-2t)) \Delta$$

**Adaptive variant**: Predict $\alpha$ from text embeddings via small MLP:

$$\alpha = \alpha_{\min} + (\alpha_{\max} - \alpha_{\min}) \cdot \sigma(\text{MLP}(c))$$

### 3.3 Cubic Spline Teacher

#### Control Point Prediction
A prompt-aware controller predicts $K$ control points $\{c_1, \ldots, c_K\}$:

$$c_1, \ldots, c_K = \text{Controller}(\text{CLIP}(c), z_0, x_1)$$

The controller is a lightweight transformer that:
1. Encodes endpoints $(z_0, x_1)$ via CNN
2. Fuses with text embeddings
3. Predicts control points in latent space

#### Catmull-Rom Interpolation
We use Catmull-Rom splines for $C^1$ continuity:

$$x_t = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=0}^{3} p_i \cdot B_i(\tau)$$

where $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$ are four consecutive control points and $B_i$ are basis functions.

#### Manifold Regularization
We regularize path length and curvature using the VAE pullback metric:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} = \lambda_1 \sum_{i=1}^{K+1} \|c_i - c_{i-1}\|_G + \lambda_2 \sum_{i=1}^{K} \|c_{i-1} - 2c_i + c_{i+1}\|^2$$

where $\|\cdot\|_G$ is the Riemannian distance induced by $G(z) = J_D(z)^\top J_D(z)$.

### 3.4 Schrödinger Bridge Teacher

#### Entropic Optimal Transport
We solve the Schrödinger Bridge problem in latent space:

$$\min_{\pi \in \Pi(\mu_0, \mu_1)} \mathbb{E}_{(z_0, x_1) \sim \pi} \|z_0 - x_1\|^2 + \varepsilon \text{KL}(\pi \| \mu_0 \otimes \mu_1)$$

where $\mu_0 = \mathcal{N}(0, I)$, $\mu_1 = p_{\text{data}}$, and $\varepsilon$ is entropic regularization.

#### Sinkhorn with Nyström
For scalability, we use Nyström low-rank approximation:

1. Sample $L$ landmark points from $z_0$ and $x_1$
2. Compute cost matrix $C_{LL}$ between landmarks
3. Solve Sinkhorn on landmarks to get dual variables $u_L, v_L$
4. Extend to full space via Nyström formula

#### Drift Distillation
The OT solution induces a time-varying drift $u_t^*$. We train a neural network to predict this drift:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{drift}} = \mathbb{E}_{z_0, x_1, t} \|u_\phi(x_t, t, c) - u_t^*\|^2$$

The final velocity is a blend: $v_t = \alpha u_\phi(x_t, t, c) + (1-\alpha)(x_1 - z_0)$.

### 3.5 Pullback Metrics

The VAE decoder $D: \mathcal{Z} \to \mathcal{X}$ induces a Riemannian metric on latent space:

$$G(z) = J_D(z)^\top J_D(z)$$

**Geodesic distance** between $z_1, z_2$:

$$d_G(z_1, z_2) \approx \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sqrt{(z_{i+1} - z_i)^\top G(z_i) (z_{i+1} - z_i)}$$

**Path length** of trajectory $\{z_0, \ldots, z_T\}$:

$$\ell = \sum_{i=0}^{T-1} d_G(z_i, z_{i+1})$$

**Curvature** (discrete second derivative):

$$\kappa = \sum_{i=1}^{T-1} \|z_{i-1} - 2z_i + z_{i+1}\|^2$$

These metrics enable geometry-aware regularization.

**Key findings**:
- **28% improvement** in overall compositional score
- **29% improvement** in negation handling (hardest category)
- Spline teacher excels due to prompt-aware control points

### 4.4 Step Budget Ablation

| Steps | Linear RF | Quadratic | Spline | SB |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|
| 1 | 28.3 | 26.1 | **24.7** | 25.2 |
| 2 | 22.5 | 20.8 | **19.3** | 19.8 |
| 4 | 18.2 | 16.8 | **15.1** | 15.4 |
| 8 | 15.7 | 14.5 | **13.2** | 13.6 |

NRF maintains advantage across all step budgets, with gains increasing at lower steps (where efficiency matters most).

### 4.5 Ablation Studies

**Spline control points**:
| K | FID | CLIPScore |
|---|-----|-----------|
| 1 | 16.9 | 0.295 |
| 3 | **15.1** | **0.312** |
| 5 | 15.3 | 0.310 |

K=3 provides best trade-off between expressiveness and stability.

**Regularization weights**:
| $\lambda_1$ | $\lambda_2$ | FID | Path Length |
|-------------|-------------|-----|-------------|
| 0.0 | 0.0 | 16.2 | 12.8 |
| 0.1 | 0.05 | **15.1** | **9.3** |
| 0.5 | 0.2 | 15.8 | 7.1 |

Moderate regularization reduces path length while maintaining quality.

## 5. Analysis

### 5.1 Trajectory Visualization

We visualize trajectories in 2D PCA of latent space:

- **Linear RF**: Straight lines, often pass through low-density regions
- **Quadratic**: Gentle curves, avoid some low-density areas
- **Spline**: Adaptive curves following data manifold
- **SB**: Distribution-aware paths with minimal transport cost

### 5.2 Failure Case Analysis

**Linear RF failures**:
- "Red cube on blue sphere" → colors swap (trajectory crosses color boundary)
- "Cat without collar" → collar appears (negation ignored)

**NRF improvements**:
- Spline trajectories curve around color boundaries
- SB drift respects distribution structure, avoiding impossible regions

### 5.3 Computational Cost

| Method | Training Time | Inference Time (4 steps) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Linear RF | 1.0× | 1.0× |
| Quadratic | 1.05× | 1.02× |
| Spline | 1.3× | 1.1× |
| SB | 2.1× | 1.15× |

NRF adds modest overhead. Spline controller is lightweight. SB training is expensive but inference is fast (drift net is amortized).

## 6. Limitations and Future Work

**Limitations**:
1. Pullback metric computation is expensive (we use Monte Carlo approximation)
2. SB requires periodic OT recomputation during training
3. Evaluation on 3D/video generation remains unexplored

**Future directions**:
1. **Learned metrics**: Replace VAE Jacobian with learned Riemannian metrics
2. **Higher-order splines**: B-splines, NURBS for more control
3. **Multi-modal conditioning**: Extend to image+text, audio, etc.
4. **Theoretical analysis**: Convergence guarantees for nonlinear teachers

---

## 7. Conclusion

We introduced **Nonlinear Rectified Flows (NRF)**, which replace linear RF supervision with geometry-aware nonlinear teachers. By integrating quadratic paths, prompt-aware cubic splines, and Schrödinger Bridge drifts with VAE pullback metrics, NRF achieves:

- **17% FID improvement** over Linear RF at 4-step budgets
- **28% compositional CLIPScore improvement**
- **29% better negation handling**

Our results demonstrate that nonlinear supervision—"curved because the data demand it"—delivers faster, more faithful, and less hallucinatory image generation. NRF preserves RF's few-step efficiency while dramatically improving compositional capabilities, making it ideal for latency-sensitive applications.
